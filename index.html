        <dt>1 Timothy 17</dt>
        <dd>Now to the King, eternal, immortal,invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen</dd>
        <dt>1 Timothy 3:16</dt>
        <dd> Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:

            He appeared in the flesh,
            was vindicated by the Spirit,[a]
            was seen by angels,
            was preached among the nations,
            was believed on in the world,
            was taken up in glory.</dd>
        <dt>Rev 1:8</dt>
        <dd><p>I am Alpha and Omega, the <b>beginning</b> and the <b>ending</b>,  saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </p></dd>
        <dt>Rev 4:8</dt>
        <dd><p>And the four beasts had each of them <b>six wings</b> about him; and  they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.  </p></dd>
        <dt>Rev 11:17</dt>
        <dd><p>Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast,  and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast  reigned.</p></dd>
        <dt>Eph  4:6-8</dt>
        <dd>
            Eph 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism; One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</dd>
        <dt>1Co 8:5-6</dt>
        <dd>
            <sup>5</sup>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,). <sup>6</sup>But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
        </dd>

        <dt>Rev 19:6</dt>
        <dd> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</dd>

        <dt>Rev 21:22</dt>
        <dd> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</dd>

        <dt>Col 1:12-22</dt>
        <dd>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
            Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
            In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
            Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
            For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
            And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
            And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
            For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
            And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
            And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
            In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</dd>

        <dt>Phi 2:5-11</dt>
        <dd>
            Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
            Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
            But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
            And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
            Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
            That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
            And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</dd>

        <dt>Rev 4:8</dt>
        <dd><sup>8</sup>
        Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying
            <br>
            <q>Holy, holy, holy<br>
                is the Lord God Almighty <br>
                who was, and is, and is to come</q><br>
            <sup>9</sup>
            Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders, fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>You are worthy, our Lord and God, <br>
                to receive glory and honor and power, <br>
                for you created all things, <br>
                and by your will they were created <br>
                and have their being</q>
        </dd>
        <dt></dt>

<div id="Paul">Grace of God</div>
<dt>1 Tim 12-17</dt>
<dd><p>12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 13 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 14 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

    <br>
    <sup>15</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinnersâ€”of whom I am the worst. 16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p></dd>
