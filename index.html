        <dt>1 Timothy 17</dt>
        <dd>Now to the King, eternal, immortal,invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen</dd>
        <dt>1 Timothy 3:16</dt>
        <dd> Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:

            He appeared in the flesh,
            was vindicated by the Spirit,[a]
            was seen by angels,
            was preached among the nations,
            was believed on in the world,
            was taken up in glory.</dd>
        <dt>Rev 1:8</dt>
        <dd><p>I am Alpha and Omega, the <b>beginning</b> and the <b>ending</b>,  saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. </p></dd>
        <dt>Rev 4:8</dt>
        <dd><p>And the four beasts had each of them <b>six wings</b> about him; and  they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.  </p></dd>
        <dt>Rev 11:17</dt>
        <dd><p>Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast,  and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast  reigned.</p></dd>
        <dt>Eph  4:6-8</dt>
        <dd>
            Eph 4:4 There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one faith, one baptism; One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</dd>
        <dt>1Co 8:5-6</dt>
        <dd>
            <sup>5</sup>For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,). <sup>6</sup>But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
        </dd>

        <dt>Rev 19:6</dt>
        <dd> And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</dd>

        <dt>Rev 21:22</dt>
        <dd> And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</dd>

        <dt>Col 1:12-22</dt>
        <dd>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:
            Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
            In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
            Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
            For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
            And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
            And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
            For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
            And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.
            And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled
            In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:</dd>

        <dt>Phi 2:5-11</dt>
        <dd>
            Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:
            Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:
            But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:
            And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
            Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:
            That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
            And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</dd>

        <dt>Rev 4:8</dt>
        <dd><sup>8</sup>
        Each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around, even under its wings. Day and night they never stop saying
            <br>
            <q>Holy, holy, holy<br>
                is the Lord God Almighty <br>
                who was, and is, and is to come</q><br>
            <sup>9</sup>
            Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders, fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>You are worthy, our Lord and God, <br>
                to receive glory and honor and power, <br>
                for you created all things, <br>
                and by your will they were created <br>
                and have their being</q>
        </dd>
        <dt>John 1:1</dt>
        <dd>
            In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
            The same was in the beginning with God.
            All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
            In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
            And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
            There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
            The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
            He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
            That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
            He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
            He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
            And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</dd>
        <dt>John 1:29</dt>
        <dd>
            29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold ﻿the Lamb of God, which ﻿﻿taketh away the sin of the world. 30 ﻿This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was ﻿before me. 31 And I knew him not: but that he should ﻿be made manifest to Israel, ﻿therefore am I come baptizing with water. 32 And John ﻿bare record, saying, ﻿I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is ﻿he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 34 And I saw, and ﻿bare record that this is ﻿the Son of God.
        </dd>
        <dt>John 3:13-21</dt>
        <dd>And ﻿no man hath ascended up to heaven, but ﻿he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man ﻿which is in heaven. 14 And ﻿as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so ﻿must the Son of man ﻿be lifted up: 15 That ﻿whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but ﻿have eternal life. 16 For ﻿God so loved the world, that he ﻿gave his ﻿only begotten Son, that ﻿whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For ﻿God sent not his Son into the world ﻿to condemn the world; ﻿but that the world through him might be saved. 18 ﻿He that believeth on him is not condemned: ﻿but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the ﻿only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that ﻿light is come into the world, and men loved ﻿darkness ﻿rather than light, ﻿because their deeds were evil. 20 For ﻿every one that ﻿doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be ﻿﻿reproved. 21 But he that ﻿doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</dd>
        <dt>John 3:34</dt>
        <dd>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit ﻿by measure unto him. 35 ﻿The Father loveth the Son, and ﻿hath given all things into his hand. 36 ﻿He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</dd>

        <dt>John 5:18</dt>
        <dd>18 Therefore ﻿the Jews ﻿sought the more to kill him, because he not only ﻿had broken the sabbath, but ﻿said also that God was ﻿his Father, ﻿making himself equal with God. 19 Then ﻿answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing ﻿of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 20 For ﻿the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and ﻿he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and ﻿quickeneth them; even so ﻿the Son quickeneth whom he will. 22 For the Father judgeth no man, but ﻿hath committed all ﻿judgment unto the Son: 23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they ﻿honour the Father. ﻿He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but ﻿is passed from death unto life. 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿The hour is coming, and now is, when ﻿the dead shall hear ﻿the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; ﻿so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 27 And ﻿hath given him ﻿authority to execute ﻿judgment also, ﻿because he is the Son of man. 28 ﻿Marvel not at this: for ﻿the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 29 ﻿And shall come forth; ﻿they that have ﻿done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have ﻿﻿done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 30 ﻿I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because ﻿I seek not mine own will, but ﻿the will of the Father which hath sent me. 31 ﻿If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is ﻿another that beareth witness of me; and ﻿I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 33 ﻿Ye sent unto John, and ﻿he bare witness unto the truth. 34 But ﻿I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 35 He ﻿was a burning and ﻿a shining ﻿light: and ye were willing ﻿for a season to rejoice in his light. 36 But I have ﻿greater witness than that of John: for ﻿the works which ﻿the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that ﻿the Father hath sent me. 37 And the Father himself, ﻿which hath sent me, ﻿hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither ﻿heard his voice at any time, nor ﻿seen his shape. 38 And ﻿ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 39 ﻿Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and ﻿they are they which testify of me. 40 And ﻿ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 41 I receive not ﻿honour from men. 42 But ﻿I know you, that ye have not ﻿the love of God in you. 43 ﻿I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if ﻿another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 44 How can ye believe, which receive ﻿honour one of another, and seek not ﻿the honour that cometh from God ﻿only? 45 Do not think ﻿that I will accuse you to the Father: ﻿there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, ﻿in whom ye trust. 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for ﻿he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his ﻿writings, ﻿how shall ye believe my words?</dd>

        <dt>John 6:35</dt>
        <dd>I am ﻿the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and ﻿he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 36 But I said unto you, ﻿That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 37 ﻿All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and ﻿him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 38 For ﻿I came down from heaven, not to do ﻿mine own will, but ﻿the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of ﻿all which he hath given me ﻿I should lose nothing, but ﻿should raise it up again at the last day. 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which ﻿seeth the Son, and ﻿believeth on him, may have ﻿everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. 41</dd>

        <dt>John 7:37</dt>
        <dd>In the last day, ﻿that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and ﻿cried, saying, ﻿If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 38 ﻿He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, ﻿out of his belly shall flow rivers of ﻿living water. 39 (But ﻿this spake he of ﻿the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: ﻿for the Holy Ghost was not yet ﻿given; ﻿because that Jesus was not yet ﻿glorified.) 40</dd>
        <dt>John 12:27</dt>
        <dd>Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? ﻿Father, save me from ﻿this hour: but ﻿for this cause came I unto ﻿this hour. 28 ﻿Father, glorify thy name. ﻿Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 30 Jesus answered and said, ﻿This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. 31 Now is ﻿the judgment of this world: now shall ﻿the prince of this world be ﻿cast out. 32 And I, if I be ﻿lifted up from the earth, ﻿will draw ﻿all men unto me</dd>

<div id="Paul">Grace of God</div>
<dt>1 Tim 12-17</dt>
<dd><p>12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 13 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 14 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

    <br>
    <sup>15</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. 16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p></dd>
