<div id="The Trinity">
    <h4>The Trinity</h4>
    <p>This section studies the scriptures which deal with the Trinity. Meditations and adorations on scriptures with these themes solidify the teachings of the church on the Trinity</p>

<div id="To be clothed with Christ">
    <h4>To be clothed with Christ</h4>
    <p>This meditation theme looks at words from our Blessed Savior, to emphasise His Goodness. Just by meditating on His Goodness can we counter all the negativity we are facing in our daily lives in the world.</p>
