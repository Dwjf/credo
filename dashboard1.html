        <h3>Jesus speaks about his Father/Himself/Holy Spirit</h3>

        <dt><a href="">John 8:34-58</a></dt>
<dd>
    <p>Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. 35 Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. 36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. 37 I know that you are Abraham’s descendants. Yet you are looking for a way to kill me, because you have no room for my word. 38 I am telling you what I have seen in the Father’s presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father.[b]”</p>

    <p>39 “Abraham is our father,” they answered.</p>

    <p>“If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would[c] do what Abraham did. 40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things. 41 You are doing the works of your own father.”</p>

    <p>“We are not illegitimate children,” they protested. “The only Father we have is God himself.”

    42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. 43 Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say. 44 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. 45 Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me! 46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don’t you believe me? 47 Whoever belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”

    Jesus’ Claims About Himself
    48 The Jews answered him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and demon-possessed?”

    49 “I am not possessed by a demon,” said Jesus, “but I honor my Father and you dishonor me. 50 I am not seeking glory for myself; but there is one who seeks it, and he is the judge. 51 Very truly I tell you, whoever obeys my word will never see death.”

    52 At this they exclaimed, “Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. 53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?”

    54 Jesus replied, “If I glorify myself, my glory means nothing. My Father, whom you claim as your God, is the one who glorifies me. 55 Though you do not know him, I know him. If I said I did not, I would be a liar like you, but I do know him and obey his word. 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day; he saw it and was glad.”

    57 “You are not yet fifty years old,” they said to him, “and you have seen Abraham!”

    58 “Very truly I tell you,” Jesus answered, “before Abraham was born, I am!” 59 At this, they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus hid himself, slipping away from the temple grounds.

        <dd><p>12 When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”

            13 The Pharisees challenged him, “Here you are, appearing as your own witness; your testimony is not valid.”

            14 Jesus answered, “Even if I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is valid, for I know where I came from and where I am going. But you have no idea where I come from or where I am going. 15 You judge by human standards; I pass judgment on no one. 16 But if I do judge, my decisions are true, because I am not alone. I stand with the Father, who sent me. 17 In your own Law it is written that the testimony of two witnesses is true. 18 I am one who testifies for myself; my other witness is the Father, who sent me.”

            19 Then they asked him, “Where is your father?”

            “You do not know me or my Father,” Jesus replied. “If you knew me, you would know my Father also.” 20 He spoke these words while teaching in the temple courts near the place where the offerings were put. Yet no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come.</p></dd>

        <dd>35 Then Jesus declared, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never go hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. 36 But as I told you, you have seen me and still you do not believe. 37 All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away. 38 For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me. 39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of all those he has given me, but raise them up at the last day. 40 For my Father’s will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day.”

            41 At this the Jews there began to grumble about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” 42 They said, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I came down from heaven’?”

            43 “Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus answered. 44 “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last day. 45 It is written in the Prophets: ‘They will all be taught by God.’[d] Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from him comes to me. 46 No one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; only he has seen the Father. 47 Very truly I tell you, the one who believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died. 50 But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which anyone may eat and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”

            52 Then the Jews began to argue sharply among themselves, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”

            53 Jesus said to them, “Very truly I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise them up at the last day. 55 For my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in them. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will live because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Your ancestors ate manna and died, but whoever feeds on this bread will live forever.” 59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</dd>

        <dd>25 The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When he comes, he will explain everything to us.”

            26 Then Jesus declared, “I, the one speaking to you—I am he.”

        <dt>John 5:18</dt>
        <dd>18 Therefore ﻿the Jews ﻿sought the more to kill him, because he not only ﻿had broken the sabbath, but ﻿said also that God was ﻿his Father, ﻿making himself equal with God. 19 Then ﻿answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing ﻿of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 20 For ﻿the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and ﻿he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. 21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and ﻿quickeneth them; even so ﻿the Son quickeneth whom he will. 22 For the Father judgeth no man, but ﻿hath committed all ﻿judgment unto the Son: 23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they ﻿honour the Father. ﻿He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but ﻿is passed from death unto life. 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿The hour is coming, and now is, when ﻿the dead shall hear ﻿the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; ﻿so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 27 And ﻿hath given him ﻿authority to execute ﻿judgment also, ﻿because he is the Son of man. 28 ﻿Marvel not at this: for ﻿the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 29 ﻿And shall come forth; ﻿they that have ﻿done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have ﻿﻿done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 30 ﻿I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because ﻿I seek not mine own will, but ﻿the will of the Father which hath sent me. 31 ﻿If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is ﻿another that beareth witness of me; and ﻿I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 33 ﻿Ye sent unto John, and ﻿he bare witness unto the truth. 34 But ﻿I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 35 He ﻿was a burning and ﻿a shining ﻿light: and ye were willing ﻿for a season to rejoice in his light. 36 But I have ﻿greater witness than that of John: for ﻿the works which ﻿the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that ﻿the Father hath sent me. 37 And the Father himself, ﻿which hath sent me, ﻿hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither ﻿heard his voice at any time, nor ﻿seen his shape. 38 And ﻿ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 39 ﻿Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and ﻿they are they which testify of me. 40 And ﻿ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 41 I receive not ﻿honour from men. 42 But ﻿I know you, that ye have not ﻿the love of God in you. 43 ﻿I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if ﻿another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 44 How can ye believe, which receive ﻿honour one of another, and seek not ﻿the honour that cometh from God ﻿only? 45 Do not think ﻿that I will accuse you to the Father: ﻿there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, ﻿in whom ye trust. 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for ﻿he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his ﻿writings, ﻿how shall ye believe my words?</dd>

        <dt>John 6:35</dt>
        <dd>I am ﻿the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and ﻿he that believeth on me shall never thirst. 36 But I said unto you, ﻿That ye also have seen me, and believe not. 37 ﻿All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and ﻿him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. 38 For ﻿I came down from heaven, not to do ﻿mine own will, but ﻿the will of him that sent me. 39 And this is the Father’s will which hath sent me, that of ﻿all which he hath given me ﻿I should lose nothing, but ﻿should raise it up again at the last day. 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which ﻿seeth the Son, and ﻿believeth on him, may have ﻿everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. 41</dd>

        <dd><p>16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:[a] The old has gone, the new is here! 18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin[b] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.</p></dd>

            Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
            In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:
            Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
            For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
            And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
            And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.

            And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled

            And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.
            Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:

            Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, and who lives for ever and ever, the twenty-four elders, fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever. They lay their crowns before the throne and say:
            <br>
            <br>
            <q>You are worthy, our Lord and God, <br>
                to receive glory and honor and power, <br>
                for you created all things, <br>
                and by your will they were created <br>
                and have their being</q>

        <dt>John 1:1</dt>
        <dd>
            In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
            The same was in the beginning with God.
            All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
            In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
            And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
            There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
            The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
            He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
            That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
            He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
            He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
            But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
            Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
            And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.</dd>

        <dd>
            29 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold ﻿the Lamb of God, which ﻿﻿taketh away the sin of the world. 30 ﻿This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was ﻿before me. 31 And I knew him not: but that he should ﻿be made manifest to Israel, ﻿therefore am I come baptizing with water. 32 And John ﻿bare record, saying, ﻿I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him. 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is ﻿he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost. 34 And I saw, and ﻿bare record that this is ﻿the Son of God.

        <dt>John 3:13-21</dt>
        <dd>And ﻿no man hath ascended up to heaven, but ﻿he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man ﻿which is in heaven. 14 And ﻿as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so ﻿must the Son of man ﻿be lifted up: 15 That ﻿whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but ﻿have eternal life. 16 For ﻿God so loved the world, that he ﻿gave his ﻿only begotten Son, that ﻿whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For ﻿God sent not his Son into the world ﻿to condemn the world; ﻿but that the world through him might be saved. 18 ﻿He that believeth on him is not condemned: ﻿but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the ﻿only begotten Son of God. 19 And this is the condemnation, that ﻿light is come into the world, and men loved ﻿darkness ﻿rather than light, ﻿because their deeds were evil. 20 For ﻿every one that ﻿doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be ﻿﻿reproved. 21 But he that ﻿doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</dd>

            <p>24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but ﻿is passed from death unto life. 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ﻿The hour is coming, and now is, when ﻿the dead shall hear ﻿the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; ﻿so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; 27 And ﻿hath given him ﻿authority to execute ﻿judgment also, ﻿because he is the Son of man. 28 ﻿Marvel not at this: for ﻿the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, 29 ﻿And shall come forth; ﻿they that have ﻿done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have ﻿﻿done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. 30 ﻿I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because ﻿I seek not mine own will, but ﻿the will of the Father which hath sent me. 31 ﻿If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. 32 There is ﻿another that beareth witness of me; and ﻿I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. 33 ﻿Ye sent unto John, and ﻿he bare witness unto the truth. 34 But ﻿I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. 35 He ﻿was a burning and ﻿a shining ﻿light: and ye were willing ﻿for a season to rejoice in his light. 36 But I have ﻿greater witness than that of John: for ﻿the works which ﻿the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that ﻿the Father hath sent me. 37 And the Father himself, ﻿which hath sent me, ﻿hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither ﻿heard his voice at any time, nor ﻿seen his shape. 38 And ﻿ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. 39 ﻿Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and ﻿they are they which testify of me. 40 And ﻿ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. 41 I receive not ﻿honour from men. 42 But ﻿I know you, that ye have not ﻿the love of God in you. 43 ﻿I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if ﻿another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. 44 How can ye believe, which receive ﻿honour one of another, and seek not ﻿the honour that cometh from God ﻿only? 45 Do not think ﻿that I will accuse you to the Father: ﻿there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, ﻿in whom ye trust. 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for ﻿he wrote of me. 47 But if ye believe not his ﻿writings, ﻿how shall ye believe my words?

    <dt>1 Tim 12-17</dt>
    <dd><p>12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength, that he considered me trustworthy, appointing me to his service. 13 Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown mercy because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. 14 The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.

        <br>
        <sup>15</sup>Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. 16 But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 17 Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever.

        <h3>Authanasian Creed</h3>
        <p>Whoever desires to be saved should above all hold to the catholic faith.</p>

        <p>Anyone who does not keep it whole and unbroken will doubtless perish eternally.</p>

        <p>Now this is the catholic faith:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we worship one God in trinity and the trinity in unity,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither blending their persons<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nor dividing their essence.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the person of the Father is a distinct person,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the person of the Son is another,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and that of the Holy Spirit still another.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their glory equal, their majesty coeternal.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What quality the Father has, the Son has, and the Holy Spirit has.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Father is uncreated,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is uncreated,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is uncreated.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Father is immeasurable,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is immeasurable,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is immeasurable.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Father is eternal,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is eternal,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is eternal.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet there are not three eternal beings;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is but one eternal being.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So too there are not three uncreated or immeasurable beings;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is but one uncreated and immeasurable being.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similarly, the Father is almighty,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is almighty,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is almighty.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet there are not three almighty beings;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is but one almighty being.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the Father is God,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is God,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is God.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet there are not three gods;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is but one God.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the Father is Lord,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Son is Lord,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Holy Spirit is Lord.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet there are not three lords;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is but one Lord.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as Christian truth compels us<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to confess each person individually<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as both God and Lord,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so catholic religion forbids us<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to say that there are three gods or lords.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten from anyone.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Son was neither made nor created;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he was begotten from the Father alone.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Holy Spirit was neither made nor created nor begotten;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he proceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly there is one Father, not three fathers;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is one Son, not three sons;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is one Holy Spirit, not three holy spirits.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing in this trinity is before or after,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing is greater or smaller;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in their entirety the three persons<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are coeternal and coequal with each other.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So in everything, as was said earlier,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we must worship their trinity in their unity<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and their unity in their trinity.</p>

        <p>Anyone then who desires to be saved<br>
            should think thus about the trinity.</p>

        <p>But it is necessary for eternal salvation<br>
            that one also believe in the incarnation<br>
            of our Lord Jesus Christ faithfully.</p>

        <p>Now this is the true faith:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That we believe and confess<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that our Lord Jesus Christ, God's Son,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is both God and human, equally.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is God from the essence of the Father,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begotten before time;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he is human from the essence of his mother,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born in time;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely God, completely human,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a rational soul and human flesh;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal to the Father as regards divinity,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less than the Father as regards humanity.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he is God and human,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet Christ is not two, but one.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one, however,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not by his divinity being turned into flesh,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but by God's taking humanity to himself.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He is one,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; certainly not by the blending of his essence,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but by the unity of his person.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so too the one Christ is both God and human.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He suffered for our salvation;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he descended to hell;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he arose from the dead;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he ascended to heaven;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is seated at the Father's right hand;<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At his coming all people will arise bodily<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and give an accounting of their own deeds.<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those who have done good will enter eternal life,<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and those who have done evil will enter eternal fire.</p>

        <p>This is the catholic faith:<br>
            one cannot be saved without believing it firmly and faithfully.</p>
